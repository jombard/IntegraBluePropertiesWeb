### Who is IntegraBlue Properties

Jon Lombard started IntegraBlue Properties to bring an open and honest business to the property market. He is primarily interested in working with HMO landlords in Exeter and holiday homeowners across the South West.

After spending time managing property in Central London, Jon moved into the IT industry for several years. However, in the last few years, he has heavily invested in his property education to bring him up to speed with current strategies and to make a move back into property full time.

Jon lives in Dorset with his wife and daughter, and when he is not working on his business or spending time with his family, you can find him running around the trails of the hilly Dorset coastline.
