**Did you know you could make up to double your monthly mortgage payments in as little as two weeks?**

Every year, you see them come and go. Some people will be counting down the days until the end of the holiday season and some people will be wondering how they can take advantage of the influx of visitors. The good news is that it could be easier than you think to make a small fortune by letting out your property to holidaymakers. That is - if you leave it to us!

There is an essential number of factors to consider and that is where we can help.

**Do your research**

What is the demand and how much could you lease for?

**Prepare your property**

What will you do with personal items and could it do with a lick of paint?

**Sort out the insurance**

You will need landlord insurance to make sure you are compliant.

**Know your responsibilities**

Is your mortgage lender aware of your intention to rent and who will be at the end of the phone to take emergency calls?

**Know whatâ€™s required**

Credit checks and references, safety and protection are all things you now need to consider.

**Find the right customer**

Know where to advertise and how to take bookings.

This list may sound overwhelming but, at IntegraBlue Properties, we can help with each of the aspects above to ensure you have a hassle-free experience of letting out your property.

If you are interested, then please do get in touch.
