### Rent to Rent

also known as guaranteed rent

Do you want a monthly income without having to do anything? Well we can help manage the leasing of your property so you can sit back and enjoy the better things in life.

You will no longer need to worry about:
- Dealing with agents
- Dealing with tenants
- Advertising
- Marketing
- Maintenance
- Bills
- Voids between tenants
- Collecting rent
- Inspections
- Permits, certificates and licenses

**Guaranteed rent, no voids, no hassle**

We will take all of the hassle away from you, whilst ensuring you still receive a fair price for your property. We are honest and open so will always go through our plans with you in regards to what we will do with your property. Whilst we would become responsible for the day to day running and upkeep of the property, ultimately you are still the owner. We pride ourselves on our integrity and want to build solid relationships with our landlords and our tenants.

**Length of contract**

We can arrange contracts for any length of time to fit in with you. We can even look at purchase lease options if you know you would like to sell the property in the future.

**Power Team**

We have a trusted team that we work with on all our projects. From local electricians and plumbers to lawyers and accountants. We always use fair and trusted tradesmen so you can rest assured we will look after your property and your tenants.

If you have a property which you currently lease and want us to take the hassle away then get in touch today!
