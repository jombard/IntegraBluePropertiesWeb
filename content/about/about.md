### Who We Are

Jon Lombard started IntegraBlue Properties to bring an open and honest
business to the property market. He is primarily interested in working
with HMO landlords and holiday home owners.

Jon lives in Dorset with his wife and daughter, and when he is not in
front of the computer working on his web business or spending time
with his family, he can be found running around the trails of the
hilly Dorset coastline.
